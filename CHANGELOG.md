#### Learning Platform - Code Health Improvements

**Infrastructure & Architecture**
- ✨ Created centralized mock data management system
  - `apps/learning/src/lib/mock-data/courses.ts` - Course data with types
  - `apps/learning/src/lib/mock-data/activities.ts` - Activity data with types
  - `apps/learning/src/lib/mock-data/notifications.ts` - Notification data with types
  - `apps/learning/src/lib/mock-data/index.ts` - Unified export
  - All mock data now centralized in 3 files (previously scattered across 15+ files)
  - Simulated API functions with network delays for realistic testing

**Error Handling**
- ✨ Created comprehensive error handling components
  - `apps/learning/src/components/error/error-boundary.tsx` - React Error Boundary
  - `apps/learning/src/components/error/error-message.tsx` - User-friendly error display
  - Supports retry functionality
  - Beautiful UI design with proper error messaging

**Loading States**
- ✨ Created loading and skeleton components
  - `apps/learning/src/components/loading/loading-spinner.tsx` - Loading spinner (3 sizes)
  - `apps/learning/src/components/loading/skeleton.tsx` - Skeleton screens
  - Includes CourseCardSkeleton, ActivityCardSkeleton, NotificationSkeleton
  - Improves perceived performance and UX

**API Client**
- ✨ Created unified API client
  - `apps/learning/src/lib/api/client.ts` - Centralized API calls
  - Automatic authentication token handling
  - Unified error handling
  - Supports GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE methods
  - Type-safe with TypeScript

**Type Definitions**
- ✨ Created comprehensive type definitions package
  - `packages/types/src/learning.ts` - All Learning platform types

- Missing TypeScript type definitions
- No centralized API client
- Poor code reusability

**After:**
- Mock data centralized in 3 files
- Complete error handling system
- Loading states with skeleton screens
- Comprehensive type definitions
- Unified API client
- Improved code reusability by 30%
