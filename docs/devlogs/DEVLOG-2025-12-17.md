# Dev Log — 2025-12-17

## Summary
- Upgraded all Next.js apps (web/learning/storefront) to 16.0.10 to mitigate the latest security issue; aligned eslint-config-next/next-themes as needed.
- Reinstalled deps with pnpm; rebuilt web and learning successfully.
- Cleared ports 3000–3002 and restarted dev servers; storefront was initially unreachable because its dev process was not running, fixed by starting `pnpm --filter storefront dev`.

## Changes
- `apps/web/package.json`: next/eslint-config-next → 16.0.10.
- `apps/learning/package.json`: next/eslint-config-next → 16.0.10.
- `apps/storefront/package.json`: next → 16.0.10, next-themes aligned to ^0.4.6.
- Dependency reinstall via `pnpm install`.

## Verification
- `pnpm --filter web build` (Turbopack) — pass; middleware deprecation warning remains (needs proxy migration).
- `pnpm --filter learning build` (Turbopack) — pass.
- Dev servers running on:
  - web: http://localhost:3000
  - storefront: http://localhost:3001 (now reachable)
  - learning: http://localhost:3002

## Notes / Next Steps
- Migrate legacy middleware to the new proxy convention to remove deprecation warning.
- If Next bin ENOENT warning recurs, clear root node_modules and reinstall (`rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`).
