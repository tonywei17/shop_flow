# Dev Log — 2025-12-16

## Summary
- Protected all product-related routes (list, details, cart, checkout, account) behind login for the storefront.
- Simplified homepage to static promo sections; removed featured products and listing to keep unauthenticated users from seeing product data.
- Cleaned header by removing duplicate search bar; theme toggle now works with next-themes provider.
- Verified unauthenticated access to /products redirects to /login with redirect param; homepage shows only static content.

## Changes
- `apps/storefront/src/middleware.ts`: added `/products` to protected routes.
- `apps/storefront/src/app/page.tsx`: converted to static promo + CTA, no product listing; CTA adjusts based on login state.
- `apps/storefront/src/app/layout.tsx`, `apps/storefront/src/components/theme-provider.tsx`: ensured next-themes provider wraps app for working light/dark toggle.
- `apps/storefront/src/components/layout/header.tsx`: removed header search bar and kept actions on the right.

## Verification
- Manual: 
  - Home (unauth): shows static hero/features/about/CTA, no product grid.
  - /products (unauth): redirects to `/login?redirect=%2Fproducts` (confirmed via browser snapshot).

## Next Steps
- Run full lint/test suite for the monorepo if time permits; currently focused on storefront.
- After credentials confirmation, commit and push these changes to GitHub.
